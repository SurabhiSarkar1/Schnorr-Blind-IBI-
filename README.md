**Schnorr Identity Based Blind Identification Scheme**

This repository contains the implementation and analysis of Schnorr Identity-Based Blind Identification (IBBI) Scheme, a novel approach to construct a pairing-free, provably secure blind variation of the Schnorr Identification Scheme, designed to ensure user anonymity and strong security under the random oracle model. The study encompasses computational efficiency in resource-constrained environments like IoT systems and compares its efficiency.




**Contents:**

The source code for the implementation in Python Flask.
Client-Server setup for runtime efficiency and memory usage across devices (e.g., Raspberry Pi 3/local machine).




**Installation Dependencies/Libraries:**
- python 3.x
- 
### How to run the scheme:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SurabhiSarkar1/Schnorr-Blind-IBI-.git
   ```


2. **Run the Schemes**:
   ```bash
   python client.py   # to run the scheme and record ouputs
   python server.py # to initiate the server and start keygen process/verification process
   ```
