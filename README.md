**Schnorr Identity Based Blind Identification Scheme**

This repository contains the implementation and analysis of Schnorr Identity-Based Blind Identification (IBBI) Scheme, a novel approach to construct a pairing-free, provably secure blind variation of the Schnorr Identification Scheme, designed to ensure user anonymity and strong security under the random oracle model. The study encompasses computational efficiency in resource-constrained environments like IoT systems and compares its efficiency.




**Contents:**

The source code for the implementation in Python Flask.

Client-Server setup for runtime efficiency and memory usage across devices (e.g., Raspberry Pi 3/local machine).

**Installation Dependencies/Libraries:**

**How to run the scheme:** 

Use localhost 127.0.0.1 port 5000 for server connection to local

server.py to initiate the server and start keygen process/verification process

client.py to run the scheme and record ouputs
